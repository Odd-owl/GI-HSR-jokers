This is a small project that adds some balatro cards based on genshin/hsr characters that I update from time to time.
I try to keep the main branch relatively stable, but it's not guaranteed to be bug-free or fully tested at all times, however you're free to download it, try it, and edit it yourself if you want.

Requires lovely and steammodded, and a legally acquired pc copy of balatro if you want to run it.

This mod is under OSL (Owl's Stuff License), which is basically the same as normal OSL, but with the added clause that I want you to tell me in some way if you do anything with it because that would make me happy :D

If you have any questions, suggestions, or find a bug you can message me on discord (odd_owl722) or visit the thread in the balatro discord at [https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1443963518016684145](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1443963518016684145)
